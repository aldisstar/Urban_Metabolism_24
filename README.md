Socioeconomic Metabolism Project

“Socioeconomic metabolism constitutes the self reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society.”
Pauliuk & Hertwich (2015)

Data Used:
We used a comprehensive 20-year database covering all European countries, including:
Monetary Input Output Tables (MIOTs)
Physical Input Output Tables (PIOTs)
Domestic Extraction (DE)
Imports (IMP) and exports (EXP) and their raw material equivalents
Direct Material Input (DMI = DE + IMP)
Resource Productivity (RP = GDP/DMI)

Analysis and Methodology:
- The project includes a clustering analysis using two methods: k-means and hierarchical clustering, based on the average GDP and DMI over the past 20 years for all countries.
- Countries that matched in both clustering methods were grouped together.
- One cluster was selected for further analysis to examine how each economic sector contributed to the GDP of each year and each country.
- Random Forest was used to identify the key features of the economic sectors contributing to the GDP of each country.
